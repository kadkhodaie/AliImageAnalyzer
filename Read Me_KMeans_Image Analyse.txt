Why:
Applied to rock thin-section image analysis such methods save time, 
reduce subjectivity and improve accuracy compared to traditional visual techniques. 
MATLAB code was generated to automatically segment
 and measure the digital rock porosity by applying the K-means clustering algorithm. 
Image-derived 2D porosity distributions in carbonate rocks often occur in spatial clusters 
and such clusters can be mapped with cluster algorithms . 
Kâ€“means clustering is an effective way of distinguishing porosity clusters 
 and can be rapidly applied using various distance functions to minimize SSE

How:
1. The generated code should be run on Matlab environment.
2. We need to define the image name using "he = imread('nano.jpg');" 
3. The number of clusters should be selected and 
the standard deviations of their distributions applied can be varied to identify
 the number that separates the data most effectively.
4.  The total porosity can be detected using colour analyses.

How to launch the test:

1. Open the MATLAB Software
2. Copy the code to the "new script" section
3. Give the directory adress of the thin-section image that you are going to calculate its porosity.
4. Edite the name of the figure using this line "he = imread('image25.jpg');"
5. Press the run botton
6. Enter the number of colors you detected in your image. in the test image we can enter number "3".
7. Now the proccesed images have been generated and the value of total porosity (objects in class 3) is  7 percent for the test sample.
